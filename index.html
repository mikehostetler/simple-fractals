    <h2>Pythagoras Tree:</h2>
    <p>The Pythagoras tree starts with a simple square. Next two slightly smaller squares are placed on top such that their corners match up pairwise (forming a triangle composed of two right triangles). This is then repeated for each "branch" of the tree. By moving your mouse up and down in the middle of the canvas below, a true Pythagoras tree can be seen. If the mouse is moved at all to either side, an asymmetric tree is generated.</p>

    <h2>H-Tree:</h2>
    <p>An H-Tree is constructed very much like a real tree (though not random by any means). It gets it's name from the fact that when the angle between the two branches is 180 degrees, an H shape is formed. Oddly enough, this pattern has been found to be useful in designing small antenna.</p>
